title: Reproducible Research with Interactive Jupyter Dashboards
text: "Laura has just started her PhD program as part of the Land-Atmosphere Interaction in Cold Environments (LATICE) project at University of Oslo, Department of Geosciences, Norway. She is interested in exploring field data from the Finse Research Centre. Finse Alpine Research Center is located in the northwestern part of the Hardangervidda mountain plateau and is of great interest for scientists in particular biologists, geologists, geophysicists.

In addition to field data from Finse Research Centre, Laura wishes to use data from other Weather Stations available freely available from the Norwegian Meteorological Institute. She would need to clearly identify in her plots the data sources (Meteorological Institute or Finse Research Stations).
