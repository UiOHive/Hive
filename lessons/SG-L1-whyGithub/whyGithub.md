#Why a Github account?

 - **Authors**: Simon Filhol
 - **Research field**: Geosciences
 - **Lesson Topic**: What is git and Github?


All over the internet you will find that many references to git and Github. The simplest way to think of it is 1) [git](https://git-scm.com/) is a software, and 2) [Github](https://github.com/) a cloud platform that facilitate collaboration.  Before going any further **see this video** for a quick and clear intro:

## Why a version control software?

So the software [git](https://git-scm.com/) is the Version Control software that will help you track changes to your code, and set your code back to previous version easily. Originally design for code, this software can be used for other type of projects (*e.g.* website, notes, electronic project, etc.). 

This becomes very convenient when your code (or project.) start to evolve and you want to keep an history of the changes, as well as being able to go back to a previous version which for instance had not a bug recently introduced.

## Why a cloud platform like Github?

There exists a variety of other providers of online platform where to save in the cloud your version controlled project. [Github](https://github.com/) is one of them. [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/), [Gitlab](https://about.gitlab.com/), [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/), or [Launchpad](https://launchpad.net/) are other provider of a similar service. Github is the service we currently use in our team, and that we, at [UiO](http://www.uio.no/), also get an account along to our UiO account. 


## How to use all of this?

The first step is to open an account on Github, or use your UiO github account. Once you have found or create a project (aka. *repository*) you will need to copy (aka. *clone*) the project to your local computer. Then with your favorite text editor (notepad, notepad++, sublime, gedit, atom, vi, nano, or whatever) you can start create file and folder in the folder of your project on you computer. Once your done for the day you will upload (aka. *push*) changes to github after giving it some comments (aka. *commit*). The next you want to work on this project, you will download (aka. *pull*) the latest version of the project to your local computer. In this manner many people can collaborate and refer to the cloud version of the code.

For doing all this process, I usually have in my Home directory, a folger called *github*, in which I have all my different projects. This is for instance the place I will *clone* the various projects I would like to work on. From this folder, I typically use a terminal run the few useful commands. Depending on the OS platform you are using (e.g. Windows, MacOS or Linux), you might find software with a graphical interface, but many, simply use the command line from a terminal to go through that process. There are a set of few basic functions to know, which become quick and handy to use from a terminal. No need to panic! 

With this process, you will build over many days multiple version of your code, and every changes you had done will be remenbered and accessible. There are plenty of online tutorial online, from websites to videos.
